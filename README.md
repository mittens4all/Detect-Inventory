# Detect Empty Inventory

This behavior pack uses scoreboards to detect if a player has nothing in their inventory. You can then run your own commands based on the player's score.

## Installing the pack:

Add the Detect Empty Inventory Add-on to your behavior packs on your world. Behavior packs disable achievements, but editing the world with an NBT editor can re-enable achievements when uploading your world to a realm.

Re-enable achievements on either pc or mobile with the free NBT editor [Dovetail](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dovetail) 

### How to use the scoreboard example

You can give players who have nothing in their inventory an effect, like strength. This example command would be put into a repeating command block, set to unconditional, always active in a tickingarea.

```js
effect @a[scores={empty_inventory=1}] strength 1 0 true
```
